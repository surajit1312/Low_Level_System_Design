# Facade Design Pattern Example in Java

The **Facade Design Pattern** simplifies interactions with complex systems by providing a unified interface. Let's illustrate this with the example of powering on a computer, which involves coordinating multiple subsystems like the CPU, memory, and hard drive.

## Without Applying the Facade Design Pattern

In this scenario, the client must directly interact with each subsystem component to start the computer, leading to complex and tightly coupled code.

### **Code**

```java
// Subsystem components
class CPU {
    public void freeze() { System.out.println("CPU freezing."); }
    public void jump(long position) { System.out.println("CPU jumping to position: " + position); }
    public void execute() { System.out.println("CPU executing."); }
}

class Memory {
    public void load(long position, byte[] data) { System.out.println("Loading data into memory at position: " + position); }
}

class HardDrive {
    public byte[] read(long lba, int size) {
        System.out.println("Reading " + size + " bytes from LBA: " + lba);
        return new byte[size]; // Simulating data read
    }
}

// Client code without Facade
public class ComputerWithoutFacade {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CPU cpu = new CPU();
        Memory memory = new Memory();
        HardDrive hardDrive = new HardDrive();

        // Booting up the computer
        cpu.freeze();
        byte[] bootData = hardDrive.read(0, 1024);
        memory.load(0, bootData);
        cpu.jump(0);
        cpu.execute();
    }
}

```

**Issues with the Above Approach:**

- **Complexity**: The client must manage multiple subsystem components, making the code complex and harder to maintain.

- **Tight Coupling**: The client is tightly coupled to the subsystem's implementation, reducing flexibility.

## Applying the Facade Design Pattern

By introducing a facade, we can simplify the client's interaction with the subsystem by providing a unified interface.

### **Code**

```java
// Facade class
class ComputerFacade {
    private CPU cpu;
    private Memory memory;
    private HardDrive hardDrive;

    public ComputerFacade() {
        this.cpu = new CPU();
        this.memory = new Memory();
        this.hardDrive = new HardDrive();
    }

    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting computer...");
        cpu.freeze();
        byte[] bootData = hardDrive.read(0, 1024);
        memory.load(0, bootData);
        cpu.jump(0);
        cpu.execute();
    }
}

// Client code with Facade
public class ComputerWithFacade {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ComputerFacade computer = new ComputerFacade();
        computer.start();
    }
}
```

**Benefits of Applying the Facade Design Pattern:**

- **Simplified Interface**: The client interacts with a single interface, reducing complexity.

- **Loose Coupling**: The facade decouples the client from the subsystem, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.

- **Improved Readability**: The code becomes cleaner and easier to understand.

- **Encapsulation**: The internal workings of the subsystem are hidden from the client.

By applying the Facade Design Pattern, we create a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making the system easier to use and maintain.

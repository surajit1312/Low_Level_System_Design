# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** is the fourth principle in the **SOLID** design principles. It states:  

> **"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use."**

This means that an interface should have only the methods that are relevant to the specific implementing class. If an interface contains methods that some implementing classes do not need, it violates ISP.

---

## Why ISP Matters

1. **Reduces Unnecessary Dependencies:**  
   Classes should only implement the methods they actually use.

2. **Improves Code Clarity:**  
   Smaller, more focused interfaces are easier to understand and use.

3. **Encourages Flexibility:**  
   Allows implementing classes to depend only on the functionality they require.

## Example of Violating ISP

```java
// Fat Interface
interface Worker {
    void work();
    void eat();
}

// Human Worker Implementation
class HumanWorker implements Worker {
    @Override
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("Human working...");
    }

    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Human eating...");
    }
}

// Robot Worker Implementation
class RobotWorker implements Worker {
    @Override
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("Robot working...");
    }

    @Override
    public void eat() {
        // Violates ISP: Robots don't eat!
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Robots do not eat.");
    }
}
```

### Problem:

The `Worker` interface forces the `RobotWorker` to implement the `eat` method, even though it is irrelevant to robots. This violates ISP.

---

## Refactoring to Follow ISP

We can break the `Worker` interface into smaller, more focused interfaces.

### Refactored Code

```java
// Segregated Interfaces
interface Workable {
    void work();
}

interface Eatable {
    void eat();
}

// Human Worker Implementation
class HumanWorker implements Workable, Eatable {
    @Override
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("Human working...");
    }

    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Human eating...");
    }
}

// Robot Worker Implementation
class RobotWorker implements Workable {
    @Override
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("Robot working...");
    }
}

// Main
public class ISPExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Workable humanWorker = new HumanWorker();
        Workable robotWorker = new RobotWorker();
        Eatable humanEatable = (Eatable) humanWorker;

        humanWorker.work();
        humanEatable.eat();
        robotWorker.work();
    }
}
```

### Benefits of the Refactor:

1. **Adherence to ISP:**  
   Each class depends only on the methods it needs.

2. **Improved Code Reusability:**  
   Smaller interfaces can be reused across multiple classes.

3. **Better Design for Future Extensions:**  
   Adding new interfaces does not affect unrelated classes.

---

### Output of Refactored Code:

```
Human working...
Human eating...
Robot working...
```

---

## Best Practices for ISP

1. **Split Fat Interfaces:**  
   Break large interfaces into smaller, role-specific interfaces.

2. **Analyze Class Responsibilities:**  
   Ensure interfaces align with the responsibilities of their implementing classes.

3. **Use Composition if Needed:**  
   Combine smaller interfaces using composition for more complex behaviors.
